# To View the Slides:
 
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `manim-slides render padding.py`
3. `manim-slides convert Padding slides.html --open`


# Parts of the Proof

1. Intro - EXP != NEXP -> P != NP (mostly done)
2. Assumption that P = NP and Definition of L (TODO)
3. Definition of L_pad (mostly done)
4. Decidability of L using M (mostly done)
5. Decidability of L_pad using M' (mostly done)
6. L_pad is in NP. So L_pad is in P. (mostly done)
7. Final construction of TM N that uses M' (TODO)
8. Conclusion (TODO)
